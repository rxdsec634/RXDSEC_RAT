## Version-Specific Bypasses

RXDSEC RAT includes bypass techniques for security measures in Android 10-15:

- **Android 10 (API 29)**: Scoped storage, background location
- **Android 11-12 (API 30-31)**: Package visibility, storage access
- **Android 13 (API 33)**: Notification permissions, background sensors
- **Android 14-15 (API 34-35)**: Screen intents, background process

## Security Considerations

- All communications are encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
- Authentication uses HMAC and secure tokens
- Payload templates include security validation
- For more details, see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)
